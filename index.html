    <h4 class="first ninth">What is CSS?</h4>
    <ol class="second">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li><br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media</li><br>
        <li><spna id="fifth" class="sixth">CSS is not necessay</spna> <span class=" fourth sixth">CSS saves a lot of work</span>. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li><br>
        <li id="eight" class="ninth">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</li>

    </ol>
    <br>
    <h4 class="first ninth">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h4>
    <ul class="second line">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span class="fourth sixth">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles</span>, because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>

    </ul>
    <p class="third">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and itâ€™s used by JavaScript.</p>
     <p class="third">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
     <p class="third">There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
